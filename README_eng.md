Structure of business processes to automate the approval of tariffs from carriers.

# Automation of Rate Approval with Carriers

## Case Description

This case demonstrates how to optimize the rate approval process for transportation using business analysis. The current process is fully manual, leading to delays, loss of advantageous offers, and increased workload for logisticians.

## Objective

- Reduce average rate approval time from 3–6 hours to 30 minutes
- Automate ≥70% of approvals based on business rules
- Decrease loss of potential shipments due to prolonged approval delays

## Applied Business Analysis Techniques

- Stakeholder Analysis (Stakeholder Map)
- BPMN Diagrams (As-Is / To-Be)
- Business Rules Catalogue
- Decision Table
- BRD / SRS Documents
- Use Case and Acceptance Criteria
- UI Wireframe of the Logistician Interface
